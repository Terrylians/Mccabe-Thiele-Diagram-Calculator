# Mccabe-Thiele-Diagram

A tool for visualizing and analyzing the McCabe–Thiele method used in distillation column design. This calculator allows users to construct equilibrium and operating lines, step off stages, and determine the number of theoretical trays and feed stage location for binary distillation systems.

**Features**

Interactive plotting of McCabe–Thiele diagrams
User inputs for feed composition, distillate, bottoms, reflux ratio, and relative volatility
Automatic calculation of operating lines (rectifying & stripping sections)
Graphical stage stepping to determine the number of ideal trays
Feed line (q-line) support for different feed conditions
Export plots and results for reporting or further analysis

**Applications**

Educational tool for chemical engineering students
Quick design checks for distillation column sizing
Visualization aid for teaching and presentations

**Tech Stack**

Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
